# **Mautic API**
Mautic has a great API to interact with other systems. The REST API serves as a powerful gateway to the Mautic system. It supports an ample amount of calls allowing users to programmatically create, read, delete, and modify different components within Mautic.
The Mautic API requires OAuth (1a or 2) authentication. The API can be used to:
* Build meaningful integrations with in-house systems â€“ CRM, ERP, social, and more.
* Batch update Mautic components.
* Create advanced triggers and alerts.
* Achieve the valuable use case that you envision.
This guide allows you to quickly communicate with the Mautic API. For full API documentation, please refer to https://developer.mautic.org/#rest-api.
