Contribution

Hello and welcome to today's guide on „How to contribute to the Mautic Knowledgebase“.

The Knowledgebase is a collection of community contributed articles about different topics, for example „How to A/B Test an Email“ or „How to create a drip campaign“. It’s basically a library of Community Knowledge, Best Practices and How-To’s. To expand this collection we need contributions by the community.

There are different ways to contribute to the Knowledegebase and I will show and introduce you to all of them.

##1.Share your Tutorial!

The easiest way of contributing is to share an already finished ressource. It could be an article, a video or any kind of shareable resource which would be valuable to the Mautic Community. To share your Tutorial, just send it to “this email-adress” and we will take care of everything else, like proofreading, formatting into Markdown etc. And to give you the recognition you deserve for this contribution, we will give you full credit as the Author as well as a backlink to your website at the bottom of the contributed article.

FYI: If you have a ressource which is already online on your page which you would like to share but ur afraid of duplicate content, then do not fear! We will sort that out by using Canonical Tags. 

##2. Write a suggested article

We offer a collection of article that we think would be very valuable to the Community, this we have a list containing these “urgent” articles. To do that we use Jira. Jira basically is a tool for organizing tasks and issues and we use it to organize our articles. To access the board, just click on this link and you will be directed to an unsorted collection of all the tasks. To get a more organized view, please send a message to the #t-education Slack channel so that we can invite you to the Jira board. Once that has been done, you will be able to access this beautiful view. Here is a detailed explanation of how to work with the board. If you still have questions left, feel free to ask either me or just drop a message in the Slack channel!

##3. Write one yourself

You have an interesting topic which is not listed on our Jira-Board? Then feel free to write it and contribute just like in “Share your tutorial”. If you need help getting started or just anything that you need a hand for, send a message into the Slack Channel and we will help you as soon as we can!

Once you are finished, just send it to the Email address and we will take care of everything. :) 

##4. Outdated Content / Mistakes

If you find a mistake in an article or simply something which is outdated and needs a change there are two ways to do that. The “easy” on is to just send mail to “edu-contribution@mautic.org” or a message into the Slack channel, with a link to the page and closer stating what needs to be done so the editors can do the changes. 

You could also propose these changes by yourself, using GitHub. This one is more complex but I will give the most simple explanation I can give. 

Lets get started. First of all you need a GitHub account. Once you have one, you need to fork the mautic-knowledgebase repository. Do to that just click here on fork, select your account and wait until GitHub has finished forking the repository. There we go. Now you need to search for the page that needs to be edited. In the folder Pages, you will find the different menu points. The articles are stored under “Knowledgebase” and then the suiting sub-folder. Here you will find every article which is listed under the category. Lets go with “Segments”, choose this article. Now you need to open the “default.md”. Here you can see the entire article. Click on “Edit” and make your changes. The entire text is formatted in markdown, if you need a more clear visualization of your edits, just click on “Preview-Changes”. Here you will get a taste of what the article will look like. After you are done making your changes, scroll down to “Commit changes” and make your commit. Now you committed the change into your own forked repository. All we need to do now is to propose the change you made to your own repository into the master-branch of the knowledgebase, or in easier words, the live version. To do that, click on the link here to get to the repository and click on “Pull Requests”. Now you create a New Pull Requst simply by clicking on that link here. One important thing is to activate the option to compare across forks. Just klick here and you can compare across forks. As you made all changes in your own forked repository, we need to activate the compare across forks options. Now all you need to do is to select the Master branch on the left side, which is chosen by default normally and on the right side you choose your own forked repository. You will automatically see all the differences between your forked repository and the master branch. Last but not least you need to click on “create pull request”. Give it a nice description declaring all the changes you made, so others can understand what you did without having to further investigate. Propose your Pull Request and e voila! You are done. Now the editors of the knowledgebase can simply approve your changes with the click of a single button.
