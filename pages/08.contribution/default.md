# Share your tutorial!

We will handle the formatting and everthing else. If you got that tutorial/article already online on your own website we will give you a canoncial link to prevent duplicant content!

###Write a suggested article

###Outdated Content / Mistakes

If you find mistakes in an article or something which is just outdated, you can propose changes by yourself. To handle editing, we are using our GitHub repository. The knowledgebase uses Git for a couple of reasons: 
* versions - anyone can go back and look at what the text looked like.
* authorship - not only every file but every line has its author.
* community contributions - no need to worry about deleting someone else's work while working on the same document

**To Contribute using Github:**
1. Fork [this repository at GitHub ](https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-knowledgebase) 
2. Select a file to edit on your fork
3. Make your commits
4. Open a **pull request** to base fork: mautic/documentation with base: master
5. Include and reference any Issues your Pull Request addresses
