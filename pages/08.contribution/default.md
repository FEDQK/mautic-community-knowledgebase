# Share your tutorial!

We will handle the formatting and everthing else. If you got that tutorial/article already online on your own website we will give you a canoncial link to prevent duplicant content!

To give you the **recognition you deserve** for writing an article, we will give **full credit** to the **author** aswell as a **backlink** to your website at the end of each article!

#How to Contribute
The articles in this Mautic knowledgebase were written by people from the community. Thanks to their contribution, the knowledgebase grows prosperous. If you want to participate in the knowledgebase, you came to the right place! There are different ways to contribute, we listed them so you can choose which one is best for you!

###1.Share your Tutorial!

The easiest way of contributing is to share an already finished ressource. It could be an article, a video or any kind of shareable resource which would be valuable to the Mautic Community. To share your Tutorial, just send it to “this email-adress” and we will take care of everything else, like proofreading, formatting into Markdown etc. And to give you the recognition you deserve for this contribution, we will give you full credit as the Author as well as a backlink to your website at the bottom of the contributed article.

FYI: If you have a ressource which is already online on your page which you would like to share but ur afraid of duplicate content, then do not fear! We will sort that out by using Canonical Tags. 

###2. Write a suggested article

We offer a collection of article that we think would be very valuable to the Community, this we have a list containing these “urgent” articles. To do that we use Jira. Jira basically is a tool for organizing tasks and issues and we use it to organize our articles. To access the board, just click on this link and you will be directed to an unsorted collection of all the tasks. To get a more organized view, please send a message to the #t-education Slack channel so that we can invite you to the Jira board. Once that has been done, you will be able to access this beautiful view. Here is a detailed explanation of how to work with the board. If you still have questions left, feel free to ask either me or just drop a message in the Slack channel!

###3. Write one yourself

You have an interesting topic which is not listed on our Jira-Board? Then feel free to write it and contribute just like in “Share your tutorial”. If you need help getting started or just anything that you need a hand for, send a message into the Slack Channel and we will help you as soon as we can!

Once you are finished, just send it to the Email address and we will take care of everything. :) 

###4. Outdated Content / Mistakes

If you find mistakes in an article or something which is just outdated, you can propose changes by yourself. To handle editing, we are using our GitHub repository. The knowledgebase uses Git for a couple of reasons: 
* versions - anyone can go back and look at what the text looked like.
* authorship - not only every file but every line has its author.
* community contributions - no need to worry about deleting someone else's work while working on the same document
