To do that, just send the article or tutorial to **[leon.oltmanns@mautic.org](mailto:leon.oltmanns@mautic.org)**. We will handle the formatting and everthing else!

To give you the recognition you deserve for writing an article, we will give **full credit** to the **author** aswell as a **backlink** to your website at the end of each article!

If you want to participate in the knowledgebase, you came to the right place! There are different ways to contribute, we listed them so you can choose which one is best for you!

To give you the recognition you deserve for writing an article, we will give full credit to the author aswell as a backlink to your website at the end of each article! 



### 1. Jira board
We have collection of articles that would be very usefull in this knowledgebase and organized them in a Jira-Board. If you fancy an article from this list, feel free to assign yourself to it and start writing. There is a google doc linked in each and every Jira-Issue which contains usefull links and information. If you need help or guidance, don't hesitate to write me a message and I will help you getting started! Contact information are at the bottom of this article

###### [Our Jira-Board](https://mautic.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/TEDU/issues/?filter=allissues)

### 2. GitHub
If you find mistakes in an article or something which is just outdated, you can propose changes by yourself. To handle editing, we are using our GitHub repository. The knowledgebase uses Git for a couple of reasons: 
* versions - anyone can go back and look at what the text looked like.
* authorship - not only every file but every line has its author.
* community contributions - no need to worry about deleting someone else's work while working on the same document


**To Contribute using Github:**
1. Fork [this ](https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-knowledgebase) repository at GitHub
2. Select a file to edit on your fork
3. Make your commits
4. Open a **pull request** to base fork: mautic/documentation with base: master
5. Include and reference any Issues your Pull Request addresses

**Need a visual explanation? Here is a video on how to contribute!**

### 3. Write one yourself
You have an idea for an article, which is not listed on Jira-Board and want to contribute? Then please write an [Issue](https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-knowledgebase/issues) in the GitHub repository and write your article. It would be best to write the article in a Google Doc to make it easy to share it with the Team Education. Once you are finished and need proofreading, drop a message in the [Team Education Slack](https://mautic.slack.com/archives/CQGQ0D4KU).
